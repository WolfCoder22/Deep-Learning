# Semantic Segmentation with CNN
###### This directory contains a CNN which semenanticlly segmentats different objects in pictures by different classes. Mutiple conv layers, transpose convolutional, skip, and sum layers were used. 

###### The functions showing the architecture of the netwrk reside in semantic_Segmentation_train_mod() and semantic_segmentation_advanced()
