# Convolutional Neural Network used for Image Classification
###### This directory contains a CNN to classify images into 16 different categories. Data wasn't added to this Repo since it was too large. Used many different types of data preprocessing including cropping, nomralization, mean subtraction, and more. Ended up using 5 Convolutional layers followed by one pooling layer.
