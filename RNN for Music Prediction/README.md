# RNN (LSTM+ Basic)
###### This directory contains a a Long term short memory RNN (LSTM) and a bsic RNN. Both of these model were used to predict temporal music sequences with from input data

###### recurrent_tanh/lstm_forward/backword code contaisn the forward and backward pass of the RNN. Look at lstm/basic_run and create_rnn to see the architechture of the model. 
###### Training progress results uploaded in PDF files also
